<p><span style="background-color: AntiqueWhite">The German Shepherd Dog is one of America's most popular dog breeds â€” for good reason. He's an intelligent and capable working dog. His devotion and courage are unmatched. And he's amazingly versatile, excelling at most anything he's trained to do: guide and assistance work for the handicapped, police and military service, herding, search and rescue, drug detection, competitive obedience and, last but not least, faithful companion.</span></p></body>
